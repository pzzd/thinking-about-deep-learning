# Data Preparation

Goal is to adjust data for the most efficient and effective learning process without changing the meaning of the data.

## Data cleaning

We should address blanks, incorrect entries, or other errors.

- no typos, misspellings, unprintable characters, corrupted text
- remove accidental duplicates: they will skew data
- no typos with numbers like comma vs period, double negatives sign, NaN, weird choice to indicate empty numerical field
- standardized scientific notation
- features that are mostly empty
- decide on what to do with outliers

Garbage in, garbage out!
