## Artificial Neurons

An artificial neuron used in machine learning is inspired by real neurons and only has a resemblence to the real thing. Artificial neurons borrow the ideas of networking of neurons and hitting a threshold of signals.

Modern artificial neurons have these parts
- one or more inputs: An input is a floating-point number coming from an earlier output. An input is multiplied by its own floating-point weight. Each input has its own weight
- bias: every neuron has its own bias, a number value. It does not come from the output of a previous neuron.
- a step where are all the weighted inputs and the bias are added together
- action function: a mathematical function that takes the addition step as input and outputs a new floating-point value.
